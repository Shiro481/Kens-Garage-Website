Build a professional, single-page website for "Ken's Garage", a family-owned 4WD vehicle customization shop based in the Philippines. The site's primary goal is lead generation (quote requests).
Design System: Dark & rugged aesthetic. Color palette: near-black #080808 background, charcoal #161616 cards, burnt orange #FF6200 as the primary accent. Typography: Barlow Condensed (900 weight) for display headings, Barlow (300–600) for body. Add a subtle grid overlay, noise texture, and orange glow radial gradients to create atmosphere. All CTA buttons should use an angular clip-path (parallelogram/hexagon style) instead of rounded corners.
Sections (in order):

Sticky Navigation — Logo (placeholder hex badge "KG" + wordmark "Ken's Garage" with "4WD Specialists · Philippines" subtext), nav links (Services, Builds, Reviews, Contact), and a high-contrast "Get a Quote" CTA button. Collapses to hamburger on mobile.
Hero Section — Full-viewport dark background with grid overlay and rotating gear SVG decoration. Badge reading "Family Owned & Operated Since 2005". Large stacked headline: "Build Your / BEAST. / Drive Legend." (second line in orange, third as outlined ghost text). Subheading mentioning 4WD customization in the Philippines. Two CTAs: "Get a Free Quote" (primary) and "View Our Builds" (ghost). Bottom-right stats: 500+ Builds, 19 Yrs Experience, 98% Satisfaction. Animated scroll indicator bottom-left.
